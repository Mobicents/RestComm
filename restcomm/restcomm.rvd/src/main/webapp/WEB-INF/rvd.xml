		Control whether outgoing https requests verify peer site certificate or not. Two modes of operation are supported:

		'strict' : 	Requests will verify the server certificate and fail in case of an error. 
		'allowall': 	Requests will not verify the server certificate thus allowing contacting servers with certificates 
				that are not signed by a well-known CA or self-signed certificates. It's better to avoid 
				this mode in production environments.
				
		By default 'allowall' mode is used.
