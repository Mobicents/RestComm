	<!-- Absolute or relative path on which the workspace backups will be created.
	The value of the element "workspaceBackupLocation" must be different than the value of the
	element "workspaceLocation", since the backup will use the directory informed in "workspaceLocation" 
	as source and the directory informed in "workspaceBackupLocation" as target, to perform the copy operation.
	If left as blank, rvd's context root path will be used by default.
