[big black]*Step 3 – Start Restcomm and Open the Admin GUI*

* Go to the *$RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/restcomm/* directory.

* To start Restcomm and media server run the following command: *./start-restcomm.sh*

* To see the Restcomm startup process run *screen -r restcomm* (only works if you have screen installed).
To see the MMS startup process run the *screen -r mms* command.

* Open your web browser and go to the url – *http://IP:8080*.
Instead of "IP" you should put your IP.

* Log in with the *administrator@company.com* username and the *RestComm* password.
Then you should change the default password.

* If you need to stop the Restcomm you need to run *$RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/restcomm/stop-restcomm.sh* command.

[big black]*Step 4 – Making Test SIP Calls using the Demo Apps*

* Open any SIP phone of your choice.
You may use link:http://www.linphone.org/downloads-for-desktop.html[Linphone] which doesn’t require registration.

* Make sip calls at the following numbers. Take into account that first you should put you IP instead of "Restcomm_IP":

- 1234@Restcomm_IP:5080 – you will hear a welcome message
- 1235@Restcomm_IP:5080 – you will hear an hello world message in 3 languages
- 1236@Restcomm_IP:5080 – this will test the collect verb
