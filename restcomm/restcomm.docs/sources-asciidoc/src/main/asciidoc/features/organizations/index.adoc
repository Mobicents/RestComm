= Restcomm Organizations

Purpose of this document is to share the design for implementing the functionality around Organizations in Restcomm 

== What is an Organization
A virtual Restcomm plateform provided to a customer on a unique custom domain. e.g. customer1.restcomm.com

include::organizations/uml/component.adoc[]
image::uml/component.png[]

*   True multitenacy for numbers and clients. SIP numbers/clients are unique to a particular organization and not the entire plateform.

*   Routing of Numbers so they don’t conflict under a given domain/organization but can exist under other domain/organizations.

*   Provide account holders with the ability to have a custom sub-domain mydomain.restcomm.com and/or mysubdomain.mydomain.restcomm.com

*   Whitelabeling: Provide the ability to have a customizable user experience for a service provider’s end customers (a skinnable dashboard and RVD, etc.)

*   Custom URL for API calls https://mydomain.restcomm.com/%E2%80%A6[https://mydomain.restcomm.com/…]

*   Sharding of organizations/domain for scale, SLA, performance

*   Consolidated billing for a given Organization
