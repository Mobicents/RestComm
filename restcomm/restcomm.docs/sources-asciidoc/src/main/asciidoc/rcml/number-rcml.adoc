= Restcomm RCML â€“ Number

[[number]]
== Number
The *<Number>* noun specifies a phone number to dial. You can use multiple *<Number>* nouns within a *<Dial>* verb to simultaneously call all of them at once. The first call to pick up is connected to the current call and the rest are hung up.

* *sendDigits.* The 'sendDigits' attribute tells RestComm to play DTMF tones when the call is answered. This is useful when dialing a phone number and an extension. RestComm will dial the number, and when the automated system picks up, send the DTMF tones to connect to the extension.
* *url.* The 'url' attribute allows you to specify a url for a RCML document that will run on the called party's end, after he/she answers, but before the parties are connected. You can use this RCML to privately play or say information to the called party, or provide a chance to decline the phone call using <Gather> and <Hangup>. The current caller will continue to hear ringing while the RCML document executes on the other end. RCML documents executed in this manner are not allowed to contain the <Dial> verb.
