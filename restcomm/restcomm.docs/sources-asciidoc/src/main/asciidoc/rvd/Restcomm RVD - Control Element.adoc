_Control_ element performs basic tasks based on a set of conditions.
It is the equivalent of a _if-then_ control structure in developer terms.
In consists of _conditions_ and _actions_. If the conditions are satisfied
the actions are exetuted.

Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~

The set of conditions to be evaluated. Each condition can be valid or not (true/false).
It supports common comparison operations **equals, not equal, greater, greater or equal,
less, less or equal** for both numeric and string operands. In addition to that
a handy regular expression matching operation **regex match** is supported too.

==== equals, not equal, greater, greater or equal, less, less or equal

Compares the two operands. The comparison can be _numeric_ or _text_ based. For
numeric comparisons, the operands should be convertable to numbers (floats supported).
For text based comparisons any operand will do.

===== Comparison type - Text & numbers

When comparing, treating operands as numbers will not always render the same result as if operands are treated as text.
For example, **4** is less than **05** but at the same time **'4'** is greater than **'05'**. Make sure
you are always using the right comparison type. You can switch between comparison types using
the `ABCE/123` link right after the operands:

==== regex match

image:./images/ControlElement_regex_match_operation_blank.png[regex_match_operation]

Tries the to match the _text_ parameter against the regular expression in the _pattern_ parameter.
If a match is found it evaluates to true. Note that no RVD expression expansion takes
place for the pattern parameter.

==== Handling many conditions

For a single control element, more than one conditions can be evaluated. If many conditions are given, each one of them
will be evaluated individually and the all results will be combined to determine the
status of the whole complex condition. Two options are available on _how_
this is done. Either _All conditions should stand_ (AND operation) or _Any condition should stand_ (OR operation).

In the screenshot above, both _$date_ should equal '20160101' **and** $core_From should start with '555'
in order for the whole control element to evaluate to _true_.

==== No conditions present

In case there are no conditions present, the whole Control element will evaluate to true and proceed to the
execution of the actions.

Actions
~~~~~~~

A number of tasks to be executed sequentially if the condition(s) evaluate to _true_.


==== Assign action

Introduces a new variable and assignes it the value of the expression on the right.

The text box on the left with the -> icon holds the name of the variable (note that
no '$' character should be included here). A typical RVD expression can be typed
in the right side.

===== Choosing a scope

The _scope_ of the variable (i.e. for how long it will last) can be selected by clicking on the blue link
inside the text box.

In the screenshot above, `tel` variable is set to _Application_ scope.

==== Continue-to action

Changes the flow of the application to the specified module. All consequent actions
are ignored.

In the screenshot above, the flow of the application is dieverted to the `Sales` module when the action
is executed.

==== Capture action

image:./images/ControlElement_capture_action_blank.png[capture_action]

Captures part of the rvd expression in _text_ according to the _pattern_ and assigns the captured
value to a _variable_. Use a pair of parenthesis to designate the captured segment.

image:./images/ControlElement_capture_action_year.png[capture_year]

In the screenshot above, the 'year' part is isolated out of a date literal and assigned
to a `year` (application-scoped) variable.

Note, the use of a **single** pair of parenthesis is obligatory inside the _pattern_ parameter.
Also, only literal regex patterns are supported in this parameter. No RVD variable expansion will take place.

==== Action order

The order of actions significant. They will be executed one-by-one until the last action if complete,
a Contiinue-to action is executed or an error occurs. The order of actions can be altered using the re-order
buttons on the far right of the row:

Make sure to include only a single _Continue-to_ action in an element and
always make this last.
