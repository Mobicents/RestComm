= Restcomm Visual Designer

== Quick Start guide

This guide will help you learn the bare basics of Visual Designer.

=== The _Greeting_ application

==== Create the application

New applications are easily created from within the Restcomm Console. Sign into your account and navigate to the
application list view. For Restcomm Cloud accounts this is:

https://cloud.restcomm.com/#/applications

In order to create an application

* Click on the `Add New App` button. This will start the application creation wizard.
* Choose `Create a Visual Designer Application` in the next view.
Other options are importing application from local file or linking to an external one.
We will review these options later.
* In the Template Gallery pick the `Blank` template. That's the most basic Visual Designer application.
Template Gallery offers a range of options to kick start your application and can save you a great deal of time
and effort. We will stick to the bare minimum for now.
* Next, you need to name your application and choose a _type_ for it. The _name_ is not an
identifier but more like a user friendly way to refer to your app. Pick something short and descriptive.
We'll use `greeting-app` for the purpose of this example.
* The _type_ determines whether this application will respond to voice calls or SMS messages.
Choose `voice` for now.
* When done, click `Create`. This will create your application and navigate you to the
application details page. Here, you can perform management operations like
application removal. Other helpful information, such as which numbers are bound to it, is displayed too.
* Click `Design` to open the Visual Designer editor in a new tab.
* Keep the tab open. You will need it in a while.

You're almost there. Your application is operational and will greet you with the default message when called.
You do need a way to reach it though. To do that, you'll have to
bind it to a DID (a number you can call to) and finally make a call using a SIP client.


==== Bind with a number

You've just created a _voice_ application. Such applications are triggered
and respond to voice calls. You will need some sort of handle to make a call to. We call this handle a _DID_ or _Incoming Number_.
In Restcomm Console you can manage these entities in the `Numbers` section. In Cloud this is:

https://cloud.restcomm.com/#/numbers/incoming

Navigate  your browser to the _Numbers_ section. Then

* Click on the `Register Number` to start the wizard for reserving a number.
* In the form provide an identifier value for `SIP Address` and `Friendly Name`. You can use something like
a handy numeric value in both fields. For example 5555. Remember, what you define as SIP Address is where you will
call to in a while. Click `Register` to reserve this number. The operation will fail if the number has
already been reserved. That's ok, you may try another one.
* You should now see the number details form. Your number is reserved but does not point
 to your application yet.
* In the `Voice` section expand the dropdown with the list of applications. You should
see an entry named `greeting-app`. Select it.
* Click `Save changes` at the bottom.

Your number is now linked to the application.

==== Call the application

Time to execute the application. Voice applications respond to voice calls. In order to make such
one, you can use a SIP client to call the number you just registered. In Cloud you can use the WebRTC Demo client.

Get back to the Restcomm Console

* Start WebRTC Demo client. It will open in a new tab.

From WebRTC Demo client

* Create a new Contact named after the number you created. In our case this is 5555.
* Place your call and make sure your sound output device is active.
* You should hear the greeting message of the `greeting-app` application.
* Keep the tab open for later use.

=== Working with Visual Designer

Now that the plumbing is all set up, you can go ahead and extend  your applicaiton
 with more usefull and interesting features. Switch back to Visual Designer tab. Let's introduce some basic concepts.

==== Elements

On the left you will notice a long list of buttons. We call these `elements`. You can't click on them, but
you can drag and drop them into modules. Elements are the building blocks of each Visual Designer application.

You will notice that your application already contains a `Say` element. It contains the greeting that
you heard when calling the application. `Say` elements are able to convert written phrases to their
verbal representations. We call this Text-To-Speech (TTS).

==== Modules

`Elements` are grouped together in sequences we call `modules`. The whole area next to the
element toolbox is where modules appear. They are organized in a series of tabs and will accept
elements when dragged  and dropped over them. Modules are the main execution unit in a Visual Designer application.

By default new applications already contain a _Welcome_ module with the `Say` element we just
mentioned. Since this gets executed first, we call this the `Startup` module.

==== Making changes

Let's now change the greeting to something more interesting.

* Edit the default text in the `Say` element and use something more personalized like _'Hello Alice. I am glad to hear back from you.'_.
* Click the `Save` button.

* Get back to the WebRTC Demo tab and call your application once again.
* You should hear the updated greeting.

===== Validation errors

You will need to _Save_ your changes so that they are effective. In case you get a validation
error, your changes won't be applied to the actual running application. They will be persisted though so
that you don't loose your work.

==== Workflow

Once you're done, it's good practice to close the editor tab. Think of Visual Designer
as an editor like the one you edit images in. You get a new window for each new image you edit
and you're allowed to switch between them. When done, you just close what you don't need any more.
This is not required but will result in a cleaner and faster workflow.
