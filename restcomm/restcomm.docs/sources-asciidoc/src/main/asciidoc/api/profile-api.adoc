== Profiles

Profiles allow to associate behavior configuration  to specific Accounts or Organizations. Once a Profile
is associated with such Entity, the next session (USSD/Voice/SMS) attempt related to that
Entity will use the Profile configuration to tweak the service logic behavior.

During session creation the service logic will try to find the associated Profile 
based on this criteria, until a Profile is found:
*Profile associated to current Account*
*Profile associated to parent Account*
*Profile associated to related Organization*
*Default Profile*

The Default Profile is pre-provisioned in the system, and can't be modified from the
REST API. The Default Profile Sid is "PRae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf"

Since the Profile configuration is expected to grow as required, the Profile entity
is defined by a JSON schema, rather than regular properties, representing a 
document used as generic container.
