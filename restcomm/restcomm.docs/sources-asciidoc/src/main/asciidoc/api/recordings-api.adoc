To download the audio file just append *.wav* after the *RecordingSid.*

NOTE: *<Sid>* holds the file name of the recorded message. The recording Sid.**wav** is available in the file system only. 

If you want to return the recording url you will need to parse the *<Uri>/2012-04-24/Accounts/ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf/Recordings/REb4c03af76cdc4a27aad0d9d759e119bc</Uri>* response from Restcomm and add the extension .**wav**

The *<Uri>* holds the http URI that can be used for playback or to download the recorded message. 
Here is how to access the file using http *http://IP_ADDRESS:8080/restcomm/recordings/REb4c03af76cdc4a27aad0d9d759e119bc.wav*
