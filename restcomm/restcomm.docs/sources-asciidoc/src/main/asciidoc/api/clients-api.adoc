= Restcomm API – Clients

== Clients

An Client instance resource represents a user agent registered with RestComm.

=== Client Resource URI

*/2012-04-24/Accounts/\{AccountSid}/Clients/\{ClientSid}*

* Using SIP User Agents.
When using RestComm to handle SIP user agent you have to create a new Client resource, this resource acts as an account for your user agent and also dictates how calls made by the user agent should be handled.

* Client without VoiceUrl
Restcomm has a new implied behavior when VoiceUrl is not provided for a Client account. Restcomm will proxy calls from such Clients to the destination Client (only if registered) or to the destination Application DID.

Only registered Clients are allowed to use the *B2BUA/P2P/Proxy* functionalities of Restcomm. Proxying and P2P calls are only allowed between registered(authenticated) Clients.

The CDR records generated for calls made by Clients, will have account SID the account that the Client belongs to.
