- we dont need local ip and port in media server its personal to every RC instance.
- change msid to auto-increament
- remove callsid from mrb table
- convert all logs into checked logger. (if info enabled bla bla)
1. powering on mediagateways via DB not via config
2. synching mediagateways avalibility (their on off as per DB)
3. remove from DB when a RMS goes off.
4. synchronization of conference sid.
5. synchronization of master rms
6. query cdr just to get api version is not efficient. or may its ok for now

        // callsid is no more required in this table as all participant of one RC1 will on RMS1 so we only need conferenceSid and maybe instance id.
        // when someone joins we save its info in table (for first participant)
        // check if this is only participant for this name conference then fine.
        // if not then check is already brdidged &if if this participant is already on master RMS
        // if not then check if localbridge is already created for this conference endpoint or not
        // if not then check if bridge is not being initialized currently(just like conference center does)
        // if not then start shunt
        // this all should be done in mmsconferencecontroller or mrb
        // when start shunt call is received:
        // create a bridge endpoint
        // on mediagatewayreponse of bridge endpoint, save returned bridgeendpoint as local, also save in DB
        // open a connection with homebridge
        // on connection state change save sdp of home bridge (as well in DB)
        // check DB if both bridge ep are created
        // connect with other create link with one another.
        //dao.addMediaResourceBrokerEntity(ms);
